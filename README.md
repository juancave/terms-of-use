### What you receive:

- Login access to the High Performance Computing (HPC) login/headnode machines, and HPC internal scratch storage space which is visible to the HPC compute cluster.
- You will receive an email with instructions on changing your initial password.

### Funding:

- There is no direct billing to individuals or departments. Costs are incurred based on usage, and are billed at the regional/orginizational level.

### What you are responsible for

- Input data (for example CAE models or input decks) must be uploaded to the HPC scratch space. Results files are also written to that scratch space. Files on HPC scratch are automatically removed after 30 days. You should clean up any unneeded scratch files after an analysis. You should copy important results to non-HPC storage for retention or collaboration.

### Limitations/Restrictions:

- The initial login nodes are made available to allow for data organization tasks and submission of jobs to the cluster. Post-processing of result sets that are unmanageable at the desktop is allowed. Analysis/simulations should not be executed there, but should be sent to the computing cluster.

### Security Requirements:

- Users are responsible and agree to comply with Ford Information Security Policies for all data. Consult the [Ford Policy Portal](https://wwwmg1.policyportal.ford.com/D2/#d2).

### Support:

- Application support is available, especially as it relates to how to operate that application in HPC. For application technical support the software vendor or internal application owner should be consulted. See [https://www.hpc.ford.com](https://www.hpc.ford.com) for FAQ and other resources, and also [IT Connect](https://www.itconnect.ford.com/) to submit requests to "HPC".

### European PII Requirements

- Please ensure that if you plan to use European Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in any application, tool or resource from this site, You MUST contact DPEurope@ford.com to raise a Pre-DPIA EU Data Protection Office - Data Privacy Impact Assessments (sharepoint.com) and have this approved prior to using with any European PII.
